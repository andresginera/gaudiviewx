How to install
==============

GaudViewX has a very easy installation, but first you need to have installed ChimeraX in your machine.
For this you have to download the `last version of ChimeraX <https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/download.html#linux>`_
and install it.

After the ChimeraX installation, download the `GaudiView bundle <https://github.com/andresginera/gaudiviewx>`_ and installed it with the next command in the command line inside ChimeraX:

.. code-block:console

    toolshed install path/to/bundle.whl
