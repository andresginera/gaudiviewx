Installation
==============

GaudViewX has a very easy installation, but first you need to have installed ChimeraX in your machine.
For this you have to download the `last version of ChimeraX <https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/download.html#linux>`_
and install it.

After the ChimeraX installation, download the `GaudiViewX bundle <https://github.com/insilichem/gaudiviewx/raw/master/dist/ChimeraX_GaudiViewX-1.0-py3-none-any.whl>`_ and install it with the next command in the command line inside of ChimeraX:

.. code-block:: bash

    toolshed install path/to/bundle.whl
    
.. warning:: It has been reported an error in the installation for ChimeraX versions' older than June, the 21\ :superscript:`st`.
