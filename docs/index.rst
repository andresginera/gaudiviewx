GaudiViewX
==========

GaudiViewX is a light interface to explore, view and analyze solutions from `GaudiMM <https://github.com/insilichem/gaudi>`_,
inside `UCSF ChimeraX <https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/>`_. This graphical interface is an upgrade of the interface
`GaudiView <https://github.com/insilichem/gaudiview>`_, that uses the next-generation molecular visualization framework of ChimeraX and Python3.

In addition of the GaudiView's functionalities for Gaudi's output files, like
clustering, filtering or adding new solutions, GaudViewX allows you to delete
solutions, save the current data in a new output file, undo mechanism, etc; in
essence, a better file handling.
