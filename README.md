GaudiViewX
==========

GaudiViewX is a light interface to explore, view and analyze solutions from [GaudiMM](https://github.com/insilichem/gaudi), inside [UCSF ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) based on Python 3. This graphical interface is an upgrade of [GaudiView](https://github.com/insilichem/gaudiview), that is based on Python 2 and uses [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/). ChimeraX is the next-generation molecular visualization framework of that previous version.

Features
--------

**Filtering and Clustering analysis**

* You can also do a **clustering** or a **filtering** of all the solutions with the same facility as GaudiView, but with a more user-friendly interface.

**<sup>*New*</sup></span> In-place editing of the solutions**

* You can **add** more solutions from different output files in the same Chimera session in a unique visual table. 
* And you can, also, **delete** some solutions directly from the table.

**<sup>*New*</sup></span> Less requirements and easier installation with ChimeraX**

* Unlike GaudiView, this new interface only needs of ChimeraX to installed and the framework will install the dependencies.

**<sup>*New*</sup></span> Better handling of output files**

* You can open new output files and change the whole ChimeraX session without having the need of closing the framework. 
* You have the ability of saving the modified solutions (after filtering, deleting, adding, etc) in the same or new file.
