GaudiViewX
==========

GaudiViewX is a light interface to explore, view and analyze solutions from [GaudiMM](https://github.com/insilichem/gaudi), inside [UCSF ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/). This graphical interface is an upgrade of the interface [GaudiView](https://github.com/insilichem/gaudiview), that uses the next-generation molecular visualization framework of ChimeraX and Python3.

Features
--------

**In-place editing of the solutions**

* You can **add** or **delete** more solutions from different output files in the same Chimera session in a unique visual table. You can also do a **clustering** or a **filtering** of all the solutions 

**Less requirements and easier installation with ChimeraX <span style="color:rgb(0,162,255)"><sup>*New*</sup></span>**

* Unlike GaudiView, this new interface only needs of ChimeraX to installed and the framework will install the dependencies.

**Handling of output files <span style="color:rgb(0,162,255)"><sup>*New*</sup></span>**

* You can open new output files and change the whole ChimeraX session without having the need of closing the framework. Also you have the ability of saving the modified solutions (after filtering, deletions, additions, etc) in the same or a new file.
